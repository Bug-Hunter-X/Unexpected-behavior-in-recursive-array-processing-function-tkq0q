# PHP Recursive Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a PHP function designed to process nested arrays. The function intends to extract string elements from a potentially deeply nested array structure. However, it fails to gracefully handle non-string elements, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.  The bug is located in the `processData` function.  The solution provides improved error handling and type checking to address this issue.
